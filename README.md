# adrjournal — Architecture Decision Records skill

A Claude Code skill for recording and maintaining Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs) in Michael Nygard's format:
https://www.cognitect.com/blog_posts/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

An ADR is one short markdown file capturing a single architecturally significant
decision: the **context** that forced it, the **decision** itself, and its
**consequences**. Records are immutable — when a decision changes, a new record
supersedes the old one rather than editing it.

The skill prose lives in
[`dotclaude_folder/skills/adrjournal/`](dotclaude_folder/skills/adrjournal); its
deterministic mechanics live in [`src/`](src) as a small TypeScript CLI.

## What it does

The skill keeps the parts that are easy to get inconsistent — sequential
numbering, the index, and the Nygard structure — uniform, so you can focus on the
reasoning. It has three modes, chosen from how you ask:

| You say | Mode | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| "set up ADRs", first use in a repo | **scaffold** | Creates the ADR directory with an index, a template, and the `0000` meta-ADR. |
| "record this decision", "write an ADR for X", `/adrjournal new` | **interview** | A short, focused Q&A, then writes one record. |
| "catalog our decisions", "document what we've built", `/adrjournal backfill` | **backfill** | Fans out subagents to mine existing docs and code, proposes a candidate list for you to curate, then writes the approved records. |

Invoke it by asking Claude in plain language, or with `/adrjournal`, `/adrjournal new`,
`/adrjournal backfill`.

## Automatic capture going forward

A companion `Stop` hook — `src/cli.ts nudge`, registered in the consuming
project's `.claude/settings.json` — reminds you to record an ADR when a session
produces a "decision signal": a new dependency, a new package or top-level area,
or an infrastructure / schema file. It is deliberately gentle: non-blocking, at
most once per session, and silent if you already touched an ADR that session. See
[`references/reuse.md`](dotclaude_folder/skills/adrjournal/references/reuse.md) to
register it.

## Where records live

By default records go in `docs/ADRs`. The target directory is configurable, so a
project can keep one log at the root or distribute logs per package. The CLI
takes the directory as an optional trailing argument; the hook honours an
`ADR_DIR` environment variable.

## The `src/cli.ts` helper

`src/cli.ts` owns the deterministic mechanics, run with `npx tsx` (Node ≥20.12,
with `commander`, `chalk`, and `zod` installed via `npm install`). The model
writes the prose; the CLI handles numbering, scaffolding, file creation, and
index rebuilds. Each record command takes the ADR directory as an optional
trailing argument (default `docs/ADRs`).

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cli.ts scaffold [<dir>]` | Create the directory, index, meta-ADR, and template (idempotent). |
| `cli.ts next "<title>" [<dir>]` | Print the next numbered file path without creating it. |
| `cli.ts create "<title>" [<dir>]` | Create the next record from the template and print its path. |
| `cli.ts list [<dir>]` | List existing records. |
| `cli.ts reindex [<dir>]` | Rebuild the index block in `README.md` from the records. |
| `cli.ts nudge` | Stop-hook entry: read the hook payload on stdin and maybe remind. |
| `cli.ts install [<agent_folder>]` | Copy the bundled agent files into the agent folder (default `.`, e.g. `.claude`). |

Run a command directly with `npx tsx src/cli.ts <command>`, or via the npm
script: `npm run adrjournal -- <command>`.

## Conventions

- Files are named `NNNN-kebab-title.md`, four-digit zero-padded; `0000` is the
  meta-ADR. The CLI assigns numbers — do not hand-number.
- One decision per record. Records are immutable; to reverse a decision, write a
  new ADR and mark the old one `superseded by NNNN`.
- Statuses: `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`, `superseded by NNNN`.

## Reusing this in another project

Copy the skill prose (or run `npx tsx src/cli.ts install <target>/.claude`) and
the `src/` CLI into the target, install the dependencies, and register the `Stop`
hook. Full instructions are in
[`references/reuse.md`](dotclaude_folder/skills/adrjournal/references/reuse.md).
